# fastGPT

The progression of GPT-2 codes from the original to "minimal", "nano" and
"pico":

* [openai/gpt-2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2)
* [karpathy/minGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/mingpt)
* [karpathy/nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanogpt)
* [jaymody/picoGPT](https://github.com/jaymody/picoGPT)

`fastGPT` is very similar to `picoGPT` (very small and readable), but it is
also fast (see the Benchmarks section below). The speed and readability is
achieved by using Fortran. I wrote a
[blog post](https://ondrejcertik.com/blog/2023/03/fastgpt-faster-than-pytorch-in-300-lines-of-fortran/)
introducing fastGPT.

`fastGPT` features:
* Fast? ✅
* Training code? ❌
* Batch inference? ❌
* top-p sampling? ❌ top-k? ❌ temperature? ❌ categorical sampling?! ❌ greedy? ✅
* Readable? ✅
* Small? ✅

A quick breakdown of each of the files:

* `gpt2.f90`: the actual GPT-2 model and a decoder
* `main.f90`: the main driver
* `create_model.py`: downloads the TensorFlow model and converts to our own
  format (`model.dat`)
* `encode_input.py`: encodes the text input into tokens (input file for `gpt2`)
* Matmul implementations
    * `linalg_f.f90` native Fortran
    * `linalg_c.f90`, `linalg_accelerate.c` macOS Accelerate Framework
* `pt.py`: a reference script to run PyTorch (returns the same answer)

## Build and Run

Install prerequisites:

    mamba env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate fastgpt

Configure and build:

    FC=gfortran cmake .
    make

Create the `model.dat` file from a given GPT-2 model. Supported sizes (and the
corresponding names to be used in `pt.py`, and the approximate download size):
"124M" (`gpt2`, 0.5GB), "355M" (`gpt-medium`, 1.5GB), "774M" (`gpt-large`,
3GB), "1558M" (`gpt-xl`, 6GB). This will download the model and cache it for
subsequent runs:

    python create_model.py --models_dir "models" --model_size "124M"

Now you can modify the `input` file to change the input string and set other
parameters.

Run (requires `model.dat` and `input` in the current directory):

    ./gpt2

### Example Output

The above `./gpt2` command prints on Apple M1 Max:
```
$ ./gpt2

### BLAS Implementation

You can choose which BLAS implementation to use for `matmul` using:
* `-DFASTGPT_BLAS=OpenBLAS`: Use OpenBLAS
* `-DFASTGPT_BLAS=Accelerate`: Use the macOS Accelerate Framework
* `-DFASTGPT_BLAS=Fortran`: Use the default Fortran's intrinsic `matmul`

## Benchmarks

On Apple M1 Max, inference of the above input file (20 tokens):
